C# is only just a little part of .Net Framework. The Framework combines other .net languages except C#, like VB.Net, Visual F# and others. Dot Net Framework also includes a large library, some of it we use writing on C#. With the .Net libraries we can create user interface, data access, database connectivity, web application, network communications. Also inside of the .Net Framework is a C# compiler, garbage collector, and a lots of lots of other stuff every C# programmer use in his life as that.
